Thank you for taking the time to complete this test. Please read the
instructions carefully and complete it to the best of your ability.
You have unlimited time to complete this task, although we encourage
you to deliver it ~7 days after it was provided to you.

The test has some basic mandatory features that you need to complete,
but we expect you to complete it in your own style. We will also evaluate
positively any other feature implemented on top of the required tasks.
Goal

We want you to create a functional, multiplayer version of the popular
game: Snake(see reference picture below).

This are the must have features that we require:
● Functional Multiplayer for 2 or more concurrent users
● Snake controls: Arrow Keys or WASD
● At least 1 item to increase the Snake size
● Colliding with any other object or snake part will result in death

For any other unspecified questions you might have, please feel free to
decide based on what you feel will be easier / more fun to play. For
example:
● Screen Bounds vs Loops
● Snapping Grid vs No Grid
● …

We recommend you to use Photon or Unity Networking system for the
multiplayer part, but feel free to use any other system you might be
familiar with.

Deliverables
We expect you to deliver the following:
1.Link to the repository of the Unity Project (please use the lateststable version)
